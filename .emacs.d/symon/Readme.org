** NOTE: RECENT INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES

- sparkline types are renamed:
  - =symon-sparkline-plain= -> =plain=
  - =symon-sparkline-bounded= -> =bounded=
  - =symon-sparkline-boxed= -> =boxed=
  - =symon-sparkline-gridded= -> =gridded=

** Usage

Load =symon=

: (require 'symon)

and turn on =symon-mode=.

: (symon-mode)

then a tiny system monitor is displayed in minibuffer, during idle.

** Customization

- =symon-monitors= :: List of symon monitors used to fetch system
     statuses. You can set this variable to specify what metrics to
     display and what to not. List of available monitors is provided
     below.

- =symon-refresh-rate= :: Refresh rate of symon display.

- =symon-delay= :: Delay in seconds until symon is displayed.

- =symon-history-size= :: Number of old values to keep. Sparklines
     grow faster when set smaller.

You need to restart =symon-mode= in order to reflect changes of these
4 options above.

- =symon-sparkline-height= :: Height of sparklines.

- =symon-sparkline-width= :: Width of sparklines.

- =symon-sparkline-thickness= :: Line width of sparklines.

- =symon-sparkline-ascent= :: Adjust vertical position of sparklines.

- =symon-sparkline-type= :: Type of sparklines. following
     preconfigured types are available:

  - =plain=

  - =bounded=

  - =boxed=

  - =gridded=

       =netstat=

  - =symon-darwin-network-tx-monitor= :: network TX (KB/s) via
       =netstat=

- Windows

  - =symon-windows-memory-monitor= :: memory usage (%) via =WMI=

  - =symon-windows-page-file-monitor= :: page file usage (MB) via =WMI=
