Here are my personal dotfiles.
  * zsh - shell
  * vim/neovim - text editor (depends on my system)
  * i3-gaps - window manager (linux)
    + [lemonbar](https://github.com/krypt-n/bar) - status bar (fork that supports more font formats)
    + [barr](https://github.com/OkayDave/barr) - lemonbar generator in ruby
    + [rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi) - demenu replacement
  * [hammerspoon](https://github.com/hammerspoon/hammerspoon) - windom manager (osx)

Everything here is in a constant state of flux. If you like something be sure to copy it as theres no gauruntee it will be here the next time you come looking.
