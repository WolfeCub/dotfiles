# dotfiles

Here are my personal dotfiles.
  * [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) - shell
  * [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) - text editor of choice
  * [vim](https://github.com/vim/vim)/[neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) - when emacs isn't available
  * [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) - window manager (linux)
    + I also have configuration files for my old i3 setup. They aren't going to be updated
    + [lemonbar](https://github.com/krypt-n/bar) - status bar (fork that supports more font formats)
    + [rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi) - demenu replacement
  * [hammerspoon](https://github.com/hammerspoon/hammerspoon) - window manager when I happen to be on osx

Everything here is in a constant state of flux. If you like something be sure to copy it as theres no gauruntee it will be here the next time you come looking.
