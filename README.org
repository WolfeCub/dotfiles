  Here are my personal dotfiles.
  * [[http://www.zsh.org/][zsh]] - shell
  * [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]] - text editor of choice (literate config can be found [[https://github.com/WolfeCub/dotfiles/tree/master/emacs/.emacs.d][here]])
  * [[https://github.com/vim/vim][vim]]/[[https://github.com/neovim/neovim][neovim]] - when SSHed or on a different computer
  * [[https://github.com/i3/i3][i3]]- window manager (linux)
    + I also have configuration files for a few other window managers I've experimented
      with. They probably won't be updated unless I switch off of i3.
    + [[https://github.com/krypt-n/bar][lemonbar]] - status bar (fork that supports more font formats)
    + [[https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi][rofi]] - demenu replacement
  * [[https://github.com/hammerspoon/hammerspoon][hammerspoon]] - window manager when I happen to be on osx (which is very very rare these days)

** Installing

   My dotfiles are managed using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]]. This makes it easy to add and remove modules
   (and their symbolic links).

*** One Liner
    This one line will clone my dotfiles and begin the installer.

    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WolfeCub/dotfiles/master/install.sh | bash -s -- -g <& 1
    #+END_SRC
  
*** Manual Installation
    If you don't want to use the one liner or the install script. 
    You can install each module individually using =stow [name]= as shown below.
    This allows you to only use the modules that you want.

    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      git clone https://github.com/WolfeCub/dotfiles.git
      cd dotfiles
      git submodules init && git submodules update
      stow zsh
      stow emacs
      ...
    #+END_SRC
