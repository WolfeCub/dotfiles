  #+html: <p align="center"><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/borrow_your_laptop.png"/></p>

  Here are my personal dotfiles.
  * [[http://www.zsh.org/][zsh]] - shell
  * [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]] - text editor of choice (=.emacs.d= makes up a good portion of this repo)
  * [[https://github.com/vim/vim][vim]]/[[https://github.com/neovim/neovim][neovim]] - when SSHed or on a different computer
  * [[https://github.com/i3/i3][i3]]- window manager (linux)
    + I also have configuration files for a few other window managers I've experimented
      with. They probably won't be updated unless I switch off of i3.
    + [[https://github.com/krypt-n/bar][lemonbar]] - status bar (fork that supports more font formats)
    + [[https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi][rofi]] - dmenu replacement

** Installing

   My dotfiles are managed using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]]. This makes it easy to add and remove modules
   (and their symbolic links).

*** One Liner
    This one line will clone my dotfiles and begin the installer.

    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WolfeCub/dotfiles/master/install.sh | bash -s -- -g <& 1
    #+END_SRC

*** Manual Installation
    If you don't want to use the one liner or the install script.
    You can install each module individually using =stow [name]= as shown below.
    This allows you to only use the modules that you want.

    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      git clone --recursive https://github.com/WolfeCub/dotfiles.git
      cd dotfiles
      stow zsh
      stow emacs
      ...
    #+END_SRC

   I don't need much out of a window window manager and I want to think about
   window management as little a possible while using my computer. I've found
   =i3= accomplishes this very well. Most of the time I have one window per
   workspace however 2-3 windows is not entirely uncommon.

** Zsh

   My preffered shell is =zsh=. My customization isn't anything insanely intricate
   but it's functional and I find it comfy. I =ssh= a fair amount and I find that
   having the user and host always visible is very handy. The exit code and time
   aren't used as much but they're out of my way on the right side and they're handy
   every now and then. Personally I love the syntax highlighting it helps me visually
   parse the command much more easily.

*** Other Highlights
    - Better completion
    - Colorized =man= pages
    - =C-z= to foreground a backgrounded process
    - Directory aliases
    - [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf][=fzf=]]

** Emacs
   #+html: <p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/W2t0hAZ.jpg"/></p>

   For all intents and purposes =emacs= might as well be my operating system.
   My emacs configuration used to be completely literate however the org file grew to unmanagable size.
   It's since been split up into many self contained modules that can easily be plucked into other configs
   or lazy loaded/disabled until needed.   I use =emacs= for programming, writing, emails, calandar/TODOs,
   presentations, IRC and more.

*** Highlights
    - GUI and terminal compatibility
    - Vim emulation (E.V.I.L.)
    - C#, Haskell, React, Vue and many other popular languages supported
    - General for keymaps and leader emulation
    - Hydra for the rest of my shortcut needs
    - Project management (using projectile)
    - Daemon support with isolated peprspectives for each open window

** Vim

   As wonderful as =emacs= is my configuration is highly customized and stock
   emacs doesn't cut it for me. On remote systems or when quickly editing configs
   vim is the way to go. My vim config is pretty minimal but it's very comfortable.
