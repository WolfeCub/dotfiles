* TODO Find a suitable shell setup inside emacs
  Currently I use =urxvt= as an external terminal. Ideally I would like to run
  my shell from within emacs but as of present I haven't found an experience
  smooth enough to use full time. One possibility is using eshell and doing
  all of the configuration in elisp. The other (and more likely option) is using
  =shell=, =term= or =ansi-term= with packages like [[https://github.com/killdash9/better-shell][=better-shell=]].

* TODO Write a package that integrates =org-mode= into projects
  The general idea of this package would be to have a org file that integrates
  with either projectile or git projects that can link directly to =TODO:='s in 
  code. In addition it should be able remove the TODO from the code once the org
  item has been completed.
